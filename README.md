# TravelAIR

A TravelAIR Web application POC

## Usage

**Download files :**

```sh
$ git clone GIVEN-URL 
```

Get into the travelair folder using below command

```sh
$ cd travelair 
```

**Install Gulp:**

You need to have Node.js (Node) installed onto your computer before you can install Gulp.

If you do not have Node installed already, [you can get it by downloading the package installer from Node's website.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

When you're done with installing Node, you can install Gulp by using the following command in the command line:

```sh
$ sudo npm install gulp -g
```
**NOTE:** Only Mac users need the sudo keyword. And remember the "$" in the code above just symbolizes the command prompt. That's not actually part of the command you run.

**Install dependencies :**

```sh
$ npm install 
```

**Build/Run project:**

```sh
gulp build
```
